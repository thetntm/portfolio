                I'm an up-and-coming Web Developer living in North Hollywood. I started programming when I was 14, and since then I've grown proficient in a variety of different languages, from Python to C++. I'm currently taking a class in full-stack web development at UCLA Extension. I've also experimented a bit in several game development suites, such as Unity and Gamemaker. I love programming because I enjoy solving logic problems, and there isn't much more rewarding than sitting back and taking a look at your finished product.

                While I am a programmer at heart, I also have several non-programming hobbies. I enjoy writing and literature analysis, and every Tuesday and Saturday I stream my live reaction to the newest chapter of my favorite web serial, Ward, on twitch.tv/thetntm. I also have a Youtube channel, where I occasionally post videos.
